This is our code for our CS202 Group Project at Univeristy of Alaska Fairbanks.

It is still a work in progress. Aim is for a finished "Phonebook" database in which you can add, search, modify, delete, and store records. The project will be using C++ for the coding language, FLTK for a GUI, and *hopefully* SQLite to store the database.
